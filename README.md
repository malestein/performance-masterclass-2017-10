# Use image `srcset`

## Exercise

Use `srcset` and `sizes` for the "expo" images in [src/optimised/index.html](src/optimised/index.html) (starting with `src="/assets/img/expo-*"`) to load the optimal image.
You can find the scaled images with dimensions in their filenames in [src/optimised/assets/img/](src/optimised/assets/img/).
